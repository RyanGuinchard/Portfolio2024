            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Ryan Guinchard, a software development student based in
              Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Currently attending Keyin
              College, my primary focus is on front-end development, though I'm
              always eager to take on new challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, I enjoy working on various projects, and one of
              my proudest achievements is my personal pet project. It allows
              users to easily search for foods that are safe or not safe for
              their pets, combining my love for programming with a passion for
              animals.
